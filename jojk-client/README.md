# JoJk. ReactJS-client

Well, this is my first ever application written with React. I had not written a hello world before. 
Hence the code quality might in some places be 'interesting'. However I think it works pretty well.

### Startup-guide
Should definitely be written sometime.

#### config.json
```json
{
    "firebase": {
        "apiKey": "firebase-api-key",
        "authDomain": "yourAp-id.firebaseapp.com",
        "databaseURL": "https://yourApp-id.firebaseio.com",
        "storageBucket": "yourApp-id.appspot.com"
    },
    "spotify": {
        "redirectURL": "http://example.com/auth",
        "baseURL": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/"
    },
    "auth": {
        "URL": "https://authserver.example.com"
    }
}
```
